# Mechanics Sim 
> *A teaching aid to understand Newtonian mechanics*
<hr>

## Elevator Pitch
Your teacher assigns an investigation. You click on the link that takes you to the interactive lesson. It looks like it was designed in 1999 by a blind person. You drag the slider to change the angle of a cannon. 20 seconds later, and the jpg rotates. 

**Why should it be like this?**

This Newtonian mechanics simulator is a sleek and modern tool to understand highschool physics. Sluggish websites are replaced with response and accessible tools that help students excel.
